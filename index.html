    <p>Hi. My name is Stephen Wong and I am a junior in high school aspiring to work in the technology industry. I am dedicated, responsible, and passionate. I have experience in Photoshop, Illustrator, Logic Pro X, Premiere, and Final Cut. I also have a grasp on HTML, CSS, and soon Javascript. In addition, I’ve previously volunteered at UCSF medical center over one summer and the Janet Pomeroy Center. I have always had a great interest in technology, and I continually try to learn and improve my skills with it. I have built and set up computers in the past, and I have a good understanding of the anatomy of a PC. Learning these skills have taught me the effort it takes to hurdle over a challenge. Additionally I speak a little spanish, but I am still learning. Hopefully, I will be able to use it as an asset in the work world. Although I am young and inexperienced, I plan to gain more knowledge and to prepare myself for the technology field. </p>
